You will be deploying a todo-list application on Azure Red Hat OpenShift. This application will use Azure CosmosDB as database.

In this lab, you'll learn how to build and publish a container from a software factory (here [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-s/services/devops/)) into [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/).

Then, during the (continuous) deployment, you'll use the methodology of Infra as Code, by using [ARM template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) to provision database at the same time than deploying the application on Openshift.
