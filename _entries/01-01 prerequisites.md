The Azure subscription and associated lab credentials will be provisioned. This will take a few moments. This process will also provision an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

Once the environment is provisioned, a screen with all the appropriate lab credentials will be presented. Additionally, you'll have your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster endpoint. The credentials will also be emailed to the email address entered at registration.
