### Build the application

You will now build and create a container image of your image application and the common practice is to publish it in a dedicated library of containers called a registry (docker.com is a famous one). In our case we will use private registries only accessible by us : [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/)

> Note : Alternatly you can also push the container image inside the [OpenShift Internal Registry](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/registry/registry-options.html) . The registry is a core part of the OpenShift Container platform leveraging Azure Disk storage technology. This solution is however more complex to setup and won't be covered in this workshop. 

### Using Azure Registry

An Azure Container Registry has been deployed in your resource group.

In Azure DevOps, create a visual (WYSIWYG) build pipeline and name it *"Cosmos-todo CI"*. Use it to build and publish the container image to the Azure Container Registry.

> Note: Azure DevOps also allows to create [pipeline as code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema), which means the pipeline itself is described by a YAML file in your repository. We'll stick to "visual" pipeline for didactic reason but the good practice would be to use YAML pipeline.

Go in the pipeline section and click on **New pipeline** and select at the bottom **Use the classic editor**

Select your repository

Select the **Docker Container** template.

You obtain a ready-to-use pipeline, configured to build on a Linux agent, and ready to build and push the container. You just need to specify which registry to use.

Click on the first task **Build an image** and on the right part, click on **Manage** to create a *service endpoint*. A service endpoint is like a connection string, it allows Azure DevOps to authenticate against an external service.

Once there, click on **Create service connection** and select **Azure Resource Manager**

Then, select the **Service Principal (manual)**

Enter the following parameters:
- Subscription Id
- Subscription Name
- Service Principal Id
- Service Principal Key
- Tenand Id
- Service connection name

> Those values will be given by your proctor.

Come back to your pipeline and select the **Build an image** task and now, selection the Azure subscription and then the registry previously created. If the newly created service endpoint is not present in the dropdown list, just click on the refresh button.

Perform the same action on the second task (**Push an image**). It's done, your pipeline is ready.

**Save and queue** it (let all parameters with default values), it should start after few seconds and when the result is successful after 2-3min, you should be able to go in your registry and see your container being published
